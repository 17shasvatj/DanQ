README for DanQ
===============
DanQ is a hybrid convolutional and recurrent neural network model for predicting the function of DNA *de novo* from sequence. 

Citing DanQ
===========
Quang, D. and Xie, X. ``DanQ: a hybrid convolutional and recurrent neural network for predicting the function of DNA sequences'', *Under review*, 2015.

INSTALL
=======

DanQ uses a lot of bleeding edge software packages, and very often these software packages are not backwards compatible when they are updated. Therefore, I have included the most recent version numbers of the software packages for the configuration that worked for me. For the record, I am using Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS with an NVIDIA Titan Z GPU.

Required
--------


Optional
--------
* [CUDA] () (6.5). Theano can use either CPU or GPU, but using a GPU is almost entirely necessary for a network and dataset this large.
